BrightBuds – Android Educational Application

BrightBuds is a modular Android-based educational application designed for early childhood learning (ages 2–6). The application combines interactive game modules, audio-assisted learning, and structured performance analytics to support foundational literacy and numeracy development.

The system is designed with an offline-first architecture, making it suitable for low-connectivity environments and accessible to users in under-resourced communities.

🚀 Key Features
🎮 Interactive Learning Modules

Word Builder (spelling and phonics)

Feed the Monster (counting and number recognition)

Match the Letter (alphabet recognition)

Memory Match (recall and concentration)

Family Module (name recognition and familiarity learning)

🎵 Passive Learning Modules

ABC Song (alphabet sequence recognition)

123 Song (number recognition)

Shapes Song (basic shape identification)

🔊 Audio-Assisted Learning

Integrated Text-to-Speech (TTS) for interactive guidance

Reinforces pronunciation of letters, numbers, and words

Provides real-time audio feedback during user interaction

📊 Performance Tracking & Analytics

BrightBuds captures structured user interaction data to monitor learning progress and engagement.

Tracked metrics include:

Score and star ratings

Accuracy (correct vs incorrect actions)

Attempts per activity

Time spent per module

Completion rates

The system differentiates between:

Active modules (games) → interaction-driven data

Passive modules (songs) → engagement-based data

This structured data enables performance analysis and supports future predictive analytics.

📈 Reporting System

The application includes a built-in reporting feature that generates PDF-based performance summaries.

Reports include:

Child profile information

Total plays and engagement metrics

Time spent learning

Module-level performance breakdown

Graphs and visual analytics

Reports are generated locally using Android’s PdfDocument API and can be:

Viewed on device

Saved

Shared via email or messaging platforms

👤 User Profile System

Child profile dashboard for personalised tracking

User-specific analytics and performance segmentation

Parent-linked profiles for secure data access

🛠️ System Architecture

Offline-first design using SQLite for local storage

Firebase Firestore for optional cloud sync

Efficient data handling with indexed queries (childId, moduleId)

Optimised UI components (RecyclerView, Glide) for performance

🔐 Security Features

Local storage of sensitive data (child details in SQLite)

Firebase security rules restricting access by parentId

No unauthorised access to user data

Controlled access for admin and parent roles

⚙️ Tech Stack

Java (Android Development)

SQLite (Local Database)

Firebase Firestore (Cloud Sync)

Firebase Authentication

MPAndroidChart (Data Visualisation)

Text-to-Speech API

🧠 Data & ML Readiness

The system is designed with a strong data foundation to support future machine learning capabilities, including:

Feature-like metrics (score, attempts, time spent)

User behaviour tracking

Engagement pattern analysis

Basis for adaptive learning systems

📱 Installation
